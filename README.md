# Spiritus Agentic Solutions (SAS) â€” MVP

Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn-style scaffold with a futuristic agentic-AI aesthetic.

Quickstart

1. Install dependencies (I prefer pnpm):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app uses the App Router. Pages: `/` (landing), `/services`, `/process`.

Notes

- This is an initial scaffold with accessibility, tokens, and components. Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` after installing dependencies.
